# Text-Editor
# Description
* This is a single-page application (SPA) text editor built by Trilogy Education Services, LLC/U2, Inc., using CodeMirror. In it, I demonstrate modern web technologies known as Progressive Web App functionality: allowing for caching, content fallback, offline functionality, and installing an app as a stand-alone app on the user's computer.

* I used Express.Js, several Webpack packages, Babel, and Idb. I deployed this full-stack application to Heroku where it is now live.

# Installation and Usage
* To start using JATE-PWA, first clone the repo to your server. Then run npm start to install all the dependent packages, build the files for the dist directory, and launch the server. Use your browser to access the website at localhost.

# Deployed
